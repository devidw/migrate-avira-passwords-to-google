= Prepare Avira Password Manager CSV export for Google Passwords import

Avira exports passwords like:

.Avira Export
|===
| name | website | username | secondary_username | password | notes
|===

But Google requires something like:

.https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/10500247[Google Password Import]
|===
| url | username | password
|===

== Usage
[source, cmd]
----
python migrate.py <export-file> <import-file>
----

=== Sample Usage
[source, cmd]
----
python migrate.py export.csv import.csv
----

== Jobs done by `migrate.py`
* Use only importable columns (`url`, `username`, `password`)
* Arange columns in correct order (1. `url`, 2. `username`, 3. `password`)
* Also Google required full URLs but Avira sometimes stores entries without a network protocoll (http/https) so URLs will be fixed too
* Removes entries without values for all required columns

== Open Jobs
* As Google only accepts ASCII urls but Avira can export urls including emojis they should be converted to punycode
